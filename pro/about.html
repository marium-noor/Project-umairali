            <h1>Exploring Design the human way,
                designing to delight our species</h1>
                <p>Design has always captivated me. It's the language that humans

                    use to express the universe within us, just as mathematics is the language of the universe. From the wheel to spaceships, everything involves creating, ideating, and moving forward.
                    
                    As a designer, I want to experiment, explore ideas, and delight our species by innovating and approaching every project with care. I have an insatiable appetite for learning and doing great design.
